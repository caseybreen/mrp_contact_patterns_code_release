## Summary 

This script runs all code to replicate figures and tables for the paper "Estimating Subnational Contact Patterns using Multilevel Regression with Poststratification." 

The scripts are numbered in the order they should be run. Additional supplemental analyses (e.g., )

```{r}
## library packages 
library(here)
source(here("code", "helpers.R"))

## list of rmd files 
rmd_files <- list.files(path = file.path(here("code//")), pattern=".Rmd")   

rmd_files <- rmd_files[!rmd_files %in% "00_run_all.Rmd"]

## set seed for reproducibility 
set.seed(1)

for (cur_file in rmd_files) {
	cat("================================\n")
	tictoc::tic(glue::glue("Finished with {cur_file}, time:"))
	cat("Running ", cur_file, "\n")
  	source_rmd(cur_file)
  	tictoc::toc()
	cat("================================\n")
}
```
